# 🧪 Image Load Optimization Experiment

This repository contains a series of experiments focused on optimizing image loading to improve web performance and user experience.

## 🔍 Overview

Modern websites rely heavily on visual content. However, unoptimized image loading can lead to poor performance and slow user experience. This experiment explores different techniques to enhance how images are delivered and rendered in the browser.

## 🚀 Optimization Techniques

The following strategies were tested:

1. **Lazy Loading Images**  
   Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport, reducing initial page load time and saving bandwidth.

2. **Using Modern Image Formats**

   - Implemented `.webp` and `.avif` formats where supported.
   - These formats offer significantly better compression than traditional JPEG or PNG without compromising quality.

3. **Blurry Placeholder (LQIP)**
   - Displayed a low-quality blurred version of the image while the full-resolution one is loading.
   - Enhances user experience by avoiding layout shifts and perceived lag.

## 📊 Results

Coming soon – performance comparison and metrics before and after optimization.
